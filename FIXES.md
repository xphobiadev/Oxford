# Fixes Applied - Responsive Design & Flag Images

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Responsive Design Not Working
**Problem**: Website not scaling properly on mobile devices

**Solution**: Added proper viewport meta tag
- File: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added: `viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5'`
- This ensures the browser scales content correctly on all screen sizes

**Responsive Breakpoints Already Configured**:
- 1024px (Tablets) - Grid adjustments, reduced spacing
- 768px (Mobile Landscape) - Mobile menu, single column layouts, hidden SVG connections
- 480px (Small Mobile) - Further optimized sizing, full-width nodes

### 2. ✅ Flag Images Not Working Online
**Problem**: Flag images from flagcdn.com not loading when deployed

**Solution**: Added `unoptimized` prop to all Next.js Image components using external flag URLs

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/app/languages/page.tsx` - Language listing page
   - Added `unoptimized` and `loading="lazy"` to flag images

2. `src/app/language/[lang]/page.tsx` - Individual language page
   - Added `unoptimized` and `priority` to flag image in hero

3. `src/app/campus/[id]/page.tsx` - Campus detail page
   - Added Image component import
   - Converted text icon to Image component with flags
   - Added `unoptimized` and `loading="lazy"`

**Why This Works**:
- `unoptimized` bypasses Next.js image optimization for external URLs
- External CDN images (flagcdn.com) load directly without Next.js proxy
- `loading="lazy"` improves performance by deferring offscreen images
- `priority` on hero images loads them immediately for better UX

## Configuration Already in Place

### Next.js Image Configuration
File: `next.config.ts`
```typescript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'flagcdn.com',
      pathname: '/**',
    },
  ],
}
```

### CSS Responsive Styles
File: `src/app/globals.css`

**1024px Breakpoint**:
- Adjusted grid columns for tablets
- Optimized spacing and campus diagram gaps

**768px Breakpoint**:
- Mobile navigation hamburger menu
- Single-column layouts for all grids
- Hidden complex SVG connection lines
- Vertical campus diagram layout
- Full-width buttons
- Reduced font sizes

**480px Breakpoint**:
- Further reduced sizing for small phones
- Optimized campus nodes and spacing
- Single-column stats grid
- Smaller icons and cards

## Testing Checklist

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (375px - 480px)
- [ ] Test on tablets (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Test on desktop (1200px+)
- [ ] Verify mobile menu works
- [ ] Check campus diagram stacks vertically on mobile
- [ ] Verify all text is readable at all sizes

### Flag Images
- [ ] All flags load on languages page
- [ ] Flags appear in language detail pages
- [ ] Campus pages show flags correctly
- [ ] Images load on production/deployed site
- [ ] No console errors for image loading

## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Test build
npm run build

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- All flag URLs use `https://flagcdn.com/w80/{country-code}.png`
- Flags are loaded from external CDN, not stored locally
- Next.js Image component handles lazy loading automatically
- Viewport meta tag is essential for responsive design on all devices
- Mobile menu JavaScript already implemented in Header component
